# Assorted Web Design Projects

This repository contains a few projects I've completed in primarily HTML/CSS for web design purposes. 

1 - Tribute Page - Created a quick and presentable tribute page for the great Keith Haring. Used HTML/CSS3.

2 - Portfolio Sample Page - Created a portfolio page designed primarily in HTML/CSS3 w/ Bootstrap. 

3 - Responsive Navigation Bar - Created a Nav-bar using primarily HTML/CSS w/ Jquery. 

Codepens are provided for each project in the "Readme".
